Project: Product Launch, The Power of Six


Working with John Neill, Director of Engineering at Park Road Post Production (Lord of the Rings; Return of the King, The Hobbit, District 9) and award winning author James Frey, I helped produce the launch product for Booktrack, The Power of Six.
Combining a musical score with an ambient background and specific sfx, my job as creative director was to edit and review the score, specify sfx and ambient background sound and work with a team of audio engineers and composers to bring the piece to life.
Working to an exceptionally tight deadline, the team worked around the clock to deliver the Apple store app in time for the very successful launch in New York City. Creative direction, storyboarding, editing HTML and ePubs as well as technical writing for the product itself made this role an amazing mix of technical and creative skills.
