Project: Medical Assistant Simulator

Wrote and produced detailed technical specifications for study text, interactive medical anatomies, film shoots and web-based simulations.
This product is used by medical assistant trainees for interactive training. Some of the learning materials are:
* Medical simulations where the student watches, then positions medical instruments in 3D space
* Labeled 3D images of organs, equipment and figures that can be rotated in 3D space
* Videos of procedures being performed
* Interactive training questionnaires
The end result is a sophisticated and intuitive training package that can be used as a main or supplementary training package.
Contracted for deliverables in three months, all achieved on time and on budget.
