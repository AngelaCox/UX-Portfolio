I think the best way to learn from your mistakes is to really critique your own work. I mean sure, if you know nasty people they can do it for you. Doing it yourself first is a great way to expose yourself to constructive criticism; if you can trust anyone, you can trust that YOU are being constructive! With this in mind, I'm going to work through my design process and critique some of the design decisions I made when setting up this portfolio.

# Plan to fail

Full disclosure? I scrapped my original portfolio design two weeks in. I had originally intended to create an interactive portfolio, using the non-linear story tool Twine. Seriously if you haven't already, check [this](https://twinery.org/) out.

I was seduced by how "unique" it would be, an interactive trip through my career! You can add pictures and music, or links, video... except you can't. Not really. Or rather, not without an absolutely herculean effort. And it pains me to admit, but sometimes you realise that the amount of time and effort you will dedicate to a project, does not translate into an outcome that is worth looking at. And so it was with Twine.

See? That's the output in it's most basic form. Not pretty. Lots of work to make it even a little bit presentable.
At this point, I decided to scrap this idea, and set up a simple jekyll website, using BitBucket to manage and writing content in Atom. Ta da!

# Layout
Firstly, this is not a huge site. I deliberately kept it clean and simple: easy to navigate. For example, if I'm creating high volume content such as help text, I prefer a side bar with a nested tree for navigation, with a search bar at the top. People can see the main headings for navigation and can seek further information as they require or desire. I did not want the user experience for my portfolio to involve 'seeking' information. The 'seeking' has already taken place, in wanting to see the portfolio in the first place!
