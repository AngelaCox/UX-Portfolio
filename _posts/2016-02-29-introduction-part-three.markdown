# categories: Not-quite-technical-writing Introduction About-me
---

I landed a role pretty quickly in WA- in part due to a very experienced woman working out that I understood and could implement everything she needed: I simply didn't know the correct lingo. This is a surprisingly important aspect of technical writing (and any role really) and getting contracts- you really DO need to know what things are called. If someone asks you about white space or Information Architecture and you don't know, the questioner will tell you but you probably won't get that job.

Anyway, I had a very experienced interviewer, thank goodness. She hired me and I started working on the very massive, Fiona Stanley Hospital project. This was a great role, even though it wasn't software related, I did a lot of hardware, operational ICT, electronic medical records and health record management work. As this was all online, it was very technical work. (Did I mention there were robots? That's right, there are ROBOTS working at FSH. How amazing is that??)

After a good year and a bit in WA at Fiona Stanley Hospital, my contract was coming due so I decided to move over to Queensland and start working there. Once I had settled in, I began working at NEXTXC, where I was hired as a senior technical writer to build out the technical communications function. NEXTDC has a combined development and IT environment, with data centres and a corporate office environment. The scope creep due to the many different environments was huge! I worked across the business, turning my hand to the usual development documentation but my first opensource environment, which was fun. There was a lot of operational IT documentation, a lot of corporate compliance docs, and plenty of business process documentation.

I moved to Sydney with my partner in 2015, which was a big change. I transferred with NEXTDC, however the sheer distance of my commute was overwhelming, and now in 2016 I find myself in my current role, at MYOB in Sydney CBD.
Thus concludes a short (aherm) introduction to myself. I can get something tech writer-y done now.
