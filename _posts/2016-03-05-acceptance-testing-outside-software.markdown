I've decided to write a series of posts on technical writing topics outside of software. I think there are an absolute PLETHORA of valuable skills from other industries that software technical writers can apply to their careers. We are all frantically up-skilling in API docs, information architecture, user experience and content strategy but how many of us have bothered to really think about how our processes fit into the wider business? What information security means to us? Or even just where does a procedure I wrote ACTUALLY start?

For my first post in this series, I'm going to talk a little about acceptance testing in engineering and hardware, because it is REALLY different to software acceptance testing.

If you're working in Agile software, an acceptance test (This is very open to interpretation) in it's most basic form is a yes or no answer regarding a question- usually user driven. That is, a pass or fail on a SPECIFIC user story created by a customer, given to the developers. It may be called different things, but that's the premise.

Acceptance testing in engineering or operational environments, is a lot more complex. I worked on a multi-billion dollar hospital project where test plans were monitored by independent auditors and used a cross-functional process team that may require upwards of 50 people... PER LIVE TEST.

Creating test plans in these circumstances was incredibly interesting. As a technical writer, it doesn't often fall to us to perform such functions, they're normally completed by business analysts or other specialists. The test maps themselves were huge and required months to workshop processes across multiple agencies and departments.

A good example is 'admitting a patient'. You would assume that starts at the admissions desk, yes? No. This starts with a series of potential triggers: admission following a scheduled doctor appointment, admission following an emergency doctor appointment, admission from an ambulance, admission from another hospital etc. Each of these scenarios begins a different way: there might be a doctor involved, an ambulance crew, an orderly with a wheelchair etc.

 When these are tested, one trigger and one series of options is tested all the way through the entire admission process, from entering a hospital and why, to how they get to their bed. This includes getting all the patient's details (Is the patient conscious? If not, who is giving the information?), which department takes the patient to their bed, who gets the patient INTO their bed, and so forth.

 Learning how to map processes is a valuable skill for anyone working for a business and particularly for technical writers, because the procedures we write every day, are drawn from business processes whether we realise it or not. In this particular role, I learned how to take part and manage a cross functional workshop across a business how to think a process through and map it, looking for variations, pitfalls and other issues. But a lot of my learning was around communication and how to ask the *right* questions. And learning how to map an end-to-end process, taught me a lot about writing procedures, who the audiences are (in this case, the guy pushing the wheelchair, right?) and how important a lot of this information is.
