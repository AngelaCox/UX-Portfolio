So against my better judgment, I've attempted to start a blog.

Naturally, the instant I decided, I couldn't think of a single thing to write, so instead I decided to  write a little about myself as a way of dipping my toe in the... blog pool? Hmm. Either way, I'll move to technical writing content in a few posts.

I'm a technical writer originally from New Zealand but have been living and working in Australia for nearly four years. I've been working as a technical writer for nearly 6 years now in a mix of contract, consultant and permanent roles.

I was an arts-oriented student my entire life, performing and competing on piano and clarinet. After failing my first year at uni (BComms switched to BMus), I dropped out and joined the navy as a professional musician.

I learned a lot in the navy, including how to lead a 12 person team who are all older than you, running two miles in under 16 1/2 minutes, discipline (and it turns-out-I-actually-have-some) and how to make a bed properly. I also played my clarinet real good and learned I don't like not being able to question orders I am given. Note: The navy doesn't like it when you do that.   

After leaving the navy, I decided to get a qualification. I decided psychology sounded fun, and decided to do a BSci majoring in psych because I'd never really done science before. As a little side note: being contrary is not necessarily the best reason to choose a degree. Teenagers you have been warned. I'll continue my introduction in part two: Studying Is Hard.
