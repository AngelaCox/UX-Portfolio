I'm going to talk a little about acceptance testing in engineering and hardware, because it is REALLY different to software acceptance testing. I think it's important for writers of any flavour to learn as much as possible about different environments. Plus, learning is fun!

If you're working in Agile software, an acceptance test (with a BIG variation caveat- this is very open to interpretation) in it's most basic form is a yes or no answer regarding a question- usually user driven. That is, a pass or fail on a SPECIFIC user story created by a customer, given to the developers. It may be called different things, but that's the premise.

Acceptance testing in engineering or operational environments, is a lot more complex. I worked on a multi-billion dollar hospital project where test plans were monitored by independent auditors and used a cross-functional process team that may require upwards of 50 people... PER LIVE TEST.

Creating test plans in these circumstances was incredibly interesting. As a technical writer, it doesn't often fall to us to perform such functions, they're normally completed by business analysts or other specialists. The test maps themselves were huge- and required months spent work-shopping processes, across multiple agencies and departments.

For example, 'admitting a patient'. You would assume that starts at the admissions desk, yes? No. This starts with a series of potential triggers: admission following a scheduled doctor appointment, admission following an emergency doctor appointment, admission from an ambulance, admission from another hospital etc. Each of these scenarios begins a different way: there might be a doctor involved, an ambulance crew, an orderly with a wheelchair etc.

 When these are tested, one trigger and one series of options is tested all the way through the admission process, so it includes getting all the patient's details (Is the patient conscious? If not, who is giving the information?), which department takes the patient to their bed, who gets the patient INTO their bed, and so forth.

 Learning how to get the information on how these processes work, was a very valuable skill for me. I learned how to take part and manage a cross functional workshop, and how to think
