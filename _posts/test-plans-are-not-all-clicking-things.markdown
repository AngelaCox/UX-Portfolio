Clean this up and talk about different test plans


Anyway, I had a very experienced interviewer, thank goodness. She hired me and I started working on the very massive, Fiona Stanley Hospital project. This was a great role, even though it wasn't software related, I did a lot of hardware, operational ICT, electronic medical records and health record management work. As this was all online, it was very technical work. (Did I mention there were robots? That's right, there are ROBOTS working at FSH. How amazing is that??)

This role had some serious financial penalties for f**king up and failing to deliver- I won't mention details but we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars, PER DAY. Working under this kind of pressure is incredible. The live testing was amazing to see as well. When you create a normal test plan in software, you might test for a few days if you've had a particularly busy sprint. FSH had test plans that were monitored by independent auditors and worked a cross-functional process team that may require upwards of 50 people to test.   

No pressure...

Creating test plans in these circumstances was incredibly interesting. As a technical writer, it doesn't often fall to us to perform such functions, they're normally completed by BAs or in software, QA or the testers themselves. The test maps themselves were huge- for example, 'admitting a patient'. You would assume that starts at the admissions desk, yes? No. This starts with a series of options: admission from a scheduled doctor appointment, admission from an emergency doctor appointment, admission from an ambulance, admission from another hospital etc. Each of these scenarios begins a different way: there might be a doctor involved, an ambulance crew, an orderly with a wheelchair etc. These are ALL tested by the way. All the way through getting all the patient's details (Is the patient conscious? If not, who is giving the information), which department takes the patient to their bed, who gets the patient INTO their bed, and so forth. When you read in the papers here about
