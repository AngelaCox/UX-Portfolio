Firstly, a big shout out to Katie Osborne, UX design lead at MYOB for resources and tips!

One of the better tools in the tech writer arsenal; the user survey. Generally speaking, you can learn some valuable, user-specific data points that you can't get from analytics or NPS data. 

It's the difference between qualitative and quantitative data: quantitative data is facts, figures and metrics. Qualitative data is more prescriptive, more rich but ultimately, harder to prove or use in a technical fashion. 
A user survey is rich, single user information- if this were a scientific experiment, it would be an individual case study rather than a double-blind experiment. Despite being such rich information, the value from a user survey
comes from having multiple data points to prove your hypothesis... in other words, multiple respondents. A well designed survey can aid your quest for more funding or a new documentation solution better than all the pleading 
in the world. 

I'm not going to get into NPS (net promoter score) here because you can write five blog posts and still not cover all  
of the NPS theories out there. I'll try and to stick to practical, user-survey-related steps.

**Side note:** If you're planning a survey, it's in your best interest to get management approval *at least* in principle before you begin, unless you are doing a proof of concept. Its a lot of work to put together only to hear
"Jasmyn in marketing just got HER customer survey approved last week and we aren't doing two".

## Step one: create a survey brief
Every good measure needs parameters and as such, the hardest thing in qualitative research is working out where to stop. This is just as true for science research, as it is for good UX! So firstly, establish who your audience 
is for the survey. Which particular group of customers are you targeting and why.

Now BEFORE you move on; go and check that this information doesn't already exist, nestled in some other department. Don't waste your precious time with questions you have the answers to.

Create an objective. This could be a hypothesis, a particular issue you want to solve, or a specific data set you want to acquire.
Work out how many responses you want or need. This is important, as you need to know how many responses will "prove" your answers, or even just how many of your customers are reading your emails.

Decide how you want the data to be collated, because this will decide how you ask the questions. If your questions are too long, too vague, too personal, the customers won't want to finish.  

Establish a timeframe for responses, decide if you want to send reminders and how often, and who will send them. Most large companies will have contact timeframes for how often you are allowed to contact customers- make sure to check this before selecting your user base.

I personally think the planning stage is also the best time to initially engage with stakeholders. Support, technical staff and subject matter experts are exactly the right people to help you shape and frame the questions you need to ask, using informal feedback that they have already been receiving. You'll see that we check in with this group again later!  

## Step two: write the questions
This (as with anything) is much harder than it sounds. Here are some brief recommendations for question writing:

* If you want your customer responses to prove they prefer one particular option to another, multichoice questions are your friend. Be sure to remember this can seriously backfire on you if they don't answer how you want them to.
* If you want to draw generalised inferences, try a comment box.
* Use a range of responses, even allow for 'I don't know' answers.
* Open-ended questions might illicit the right response, or they might not get specific answers and can leave the response open to interpretation. If you have to say "I'm pretty sure they mean 'x'", it is not a legitimate data point.

## Step three: participation rewards
Rewarding participants increases engagement. However, here are a few suggestions on how to frame such a reward:

* A reward for one entrant simply for participation does not increase engagement.  
* A 'game of skill' such as answering a specific question, will increase engagement.
* Do not use a game of chance. There are specific laws by country and state regarding lotteries and gambling, in Australia there is specific legislation for running promotions. I suggest checking out the [Trade Promotions and Lotteries](https://www.tpal.com.au/competition-permits-trade-promotion-permits/) website if you are interested.

## Step four: check in with relevant stakeholders
At this stage, you should have your entire project including terms and conditions checked by your legal department. You can also pass it by any subject matter experts that may have a vested interest, support or technical staff, etc. The more people you run this past, the better outcomes you will get. Don't forget, internal consumers are still consumers.

At this point, your survey should now be ready to deliver in whatever format you've chosen. Remember, you can test with a beta group if you like, before sending it to your entire mailing list. A few final points to remember:

* Make sure you've contacted every internal person that needs to know about your survey.
* Make sure this information **has not already been collected**. You should never replicate a survey that has been done already, unless a suitable period of time has elapsed.  
* If you are telling customers their data is secure, **do your research**. Make sure it will be secure before making that promise. Customer insights are not worth breaking their trust.
* Make sure you're using the correct language, corporate branding and layout.
* Make sure to thank your customers for their participation! They don't have to do this you know. A brief intro is a great place for this.

Lastly, don't forget to enjoy the process and help your customers enjoy the process. Improving your product in any way should be a win-win for everyone. If you make it a worthwhile experience for your customers, they will enjoy
being able to contribute in some way; by making things better or helping to drive a change that helps their business. Or win a prize. But bringing them along with you on your improvement journey will help increase engagement. 
Peope like feeling like the have control, like they can make a difference. Simply listening to your customers is a good way to start showing them they are making a difference.
