Working within a team of technical writers, I wrote and produced detailed technical specifications for study text, interactive medical anatomies, film shoots and web-based simulations.

This product is used by nurse and medical assistant trainees for interactive training. Some of the available learning materials are:

* Medical simulations where the student watches, then positions medical instruments in 3D space.
* Labeled 3D images of figures, organs, equipment and figures that can be rotated in 3D space.
* Videos of procedures being performed.
* Interactive training questionnaires.

The end result is a sophisticated and intuitive training package that can be used as a main or supplementary resource.
Contracted for deliverables in three months, all achieved on time and on budget.
