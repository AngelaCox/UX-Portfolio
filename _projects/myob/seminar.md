The MYOB tax seminar takes place every year across New Zealand and Australia, to take accountants and accountancy firms through the changes in tax legislation updated in the relevant years budget. The tax seminar is a huge revenue source for MYOB (over a million dollars in revenue) so there is a lot of pressure while organising and formatting the 154 page seminar workbook.

This year as well as preparing the documentation, I offered to create a research paper for the company, as we had identified that the hardcopy workbook provided was not necessarily the only way information could be presented. The only problem was the team were identifying solutions such as CDs or audio recordings of the workbook. I was concerned this didn't help the work MYOB had been undertaking in the last few years (mainly their positioning themselves with more modern cloud and SaaS based platform solutions as opposed to their more traditional desktop offerings) so I offered to identify and research alternative strategies for documentation. The research outcomes were focused on the 2017 seminar offering and subject to NDA so I cannot list them, but I will be running a hackday project at the next MYOB hackday to try and test the theory.

For the workbook, I coordinated with a large group of subject matter experts to supply the content (more than ten people), and built out the template and style guide to format and polish the content. Timeframes for editing were incredibly tight due to a few late SME deliverables, however after a mammoth effort across two days, I got the 154 pages finished and sent to the printer for printing on delivery day.
