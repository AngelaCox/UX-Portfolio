Project: analysis, spec and implementation

Working with CTO Paul Gampe, I analysed and selected Alfresco as NEXTDC's document management solution. I was given three months to analyse, test and implement the solution across the company.

Given the time constraints, Federal Enterprise Architecture was selected as a workable framework to implement across the business.

I then gathered requirements from each team and department, analysed them and performed an audit on existing documentation.

I managed my IT resourcing for the testing and migration. Permission levels were assigned and SSO implemented. Due to an unforseen and severe resource constraint, no automatic migration was possible from one system to another.

The only solution? Manual taxonomy creation. I manually created the entire structure within Alfresco, folder by folder...
After a dedicated three months, the project was completed in the timeframe, well under budget.
