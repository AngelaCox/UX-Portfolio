When NEXTDC decided to go for ISO 27001 certification, we realised the company documentation needed to be more secure and controlled.
Working with CTO Paul Gampe, we decided to implement Alfresco as NEXTDC's new document management solution. I was given three months total to analyse, test and implement the solution across the company.

Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) was selected as it is a well structured and pre-existing taxonomy, easy to implement across the business
with minimal impact.

I workshopped across the company to gather the documentation, security and storage requirements from each team and department.
Once I had the data, I analysed it and performed an audit on their existing documentation to test their requirements.
By managing my IT resource for the testing and migration phase, I had permission levels assigned and SSO implemented without incident.

I created and led training for Alfresco across the company; different training modules for consumers, admin and superadmin users.  
I created the administrator user and setup documentation and worked with IT on further configuration requirements.

My project was completed on time and within budget and NEXTDC received their ISO 27001 certification, a contractual requirement
for many customers.
