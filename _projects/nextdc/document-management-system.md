When NEXTDC decided to go for ISO 27001 certification, it was realised that the company documentation needed to be more secure, supported and 
controlled. Working with CTO Paul Gampe, we decided to implement Alfresco as NEXTDC's new document management solution. I was given three months
total, to analyse, test and implement the solution across the company.

Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) was selected as it is well structured and pre-existing taxonomy, easy to implement across the business 
with minimal impact.

I then started workshopping across the company to gather the documentation, security, storage and other requirements from each team and department.
Once I had everyone's data, I analysed it and performed an audit on their existing documentation. By managing my IT resource for the testing 
and migration phase, I had permission levels assigned and SSO implemented without incident.

I created and implemented user-driven training for Alfresco across the company; differenet training for regular, admin and superadmin users. 
I created the administrator user and setup documentation and worked with IT on further configuration requirements.

My project was completed on time and within budget and NEXTDC received their ISO 27001 certification, a contractual requirement 
for many customers.
