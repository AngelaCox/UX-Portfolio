Working with the ONEDC development team, we put together a SaaS platform for the management of multiple data centre assets in real time.
I worked with the UX team, marketing, developers and QA to put together a documentation solution for this product, including website content and design, developer documentation, user documentation and media information.

I managed the online community, responding to queries from our three mailing lists.

We created this website with three days work, everyone working together to get the site up and running and looking great.
Our CTO Paul Gampe talks a little about ONEDC in the below video.
