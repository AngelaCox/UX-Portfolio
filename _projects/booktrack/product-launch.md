Working with John Neill, Director of Engineering at Park Road Post Production (Lord of the Rings; Return of the King, The Hobbit, District 9) and author James Frey, I helped produce the launch product for Booktrack, The Power of Six. Combining a musical score with an ambient background track and specific sfx, my job as creative director was to edit and review the score, specify sfx and ambient background sound and work with a team of audio engineers and composers to bring the piece to life.

The image above shows a small section of marked up text from a Booktrack version of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.   

Working to an exceptionally tight deadline, the team worked around the clock to deliver the Apple store app in time for the very successful launch in New York City. Creative direction, storyboarding, editing HTML and ePubs as well as technical writing for the product itself made this role an amazing mix of technical and creative skills.
Below is an excerpt of our mocked up finished product for the Power of 6 (Spot the typo in the video! That was not delivered in the final product).
