This is my updated portfolio, since beginning an attempted career change, from technical writing to UX. 

You can see it's moved about- I've cloned this from Bitbucket so you lucky peeps can review what I've been updating!

Previous to this, tools I was playing about with for my portfolio include:
python
Ubuntu
TravisCI
Publican

... obviously not all at once.

My current portfolio (https://angportfolio.aerobatic.io/) utilises:
Atom
GitKraken
BitBucket
Aerobatic
I had a bit of help on the CSS previously (Sam Wilson) but going forward this GitHub Pages version is all my own work. 

It's also a work in progress, so my apologies if it's ridiculous.
