  "body": "### About\r\n\r\nI'm a UX designer specialising in usable interface, content strategy and IA. I love to create human-centred designs that surprise you with their simplicity.\r\n\r\nSeven years experience as a software tech writer gives me a intuitive understanding of interface design such as error messaging, or the importance of leveraging small areas of real estate with big messages.\r\n\r\nMy psychology degree taught me efficient research design, but also taught me to how to build humanity into software. \r\n\r\nI enjoy a good story, but understand the importance of listening.",
